# Quantum chemistry in python (QCiP) tools library

Library maintained by [Pierre Beaujean](https://pierrebeaujean.net) to ease the manipulation of quantum chemistry results in Python 3. Created in the frame of my PhD thesis in the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be).

Current release: [release-v0.6.5](https://github.com/pierre-24/qcip_tools/releases/tag/release-v0.6.5)
(see [the changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)).

## Purpose

+ General purpose objects (molecule, atom, basis set) ;
+ Handle and post-analyze results of calculations (currently, electrical and geometrical derivatives of the energy) ;
+ Retrieve data from quantum chemistry package and create input files (currently Gaussian, Dalton and GAMESS).
